#News Corp Australia Front End Challenge One
This repo contains the files for Challenge One of the News Corp Australia Coding Challenge.

#Objective
The designer has given you a mock-up of a responsive news content module (nca-design-mock-scenario-1.png).

Objective: Build a complete HTML document including CSS to generate the module with a responsive layout.

#Solution
The solution is built with HTML and CSS. Along with this, BootStrap and Font Awesome has been utilised to assist in responsiveness and other graphical elements of the page. 
They are technologies that continue to advance and make front end development much easier with their unique classes that are available for use.
